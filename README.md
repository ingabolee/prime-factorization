# prime-factorization
This project is an implementation of [Fermat's factorization method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_factorization_method) in which multiples of prime numbers are factored into their constituent primes. It is a vanity attempt to break RSA Encryption which relies on the infeasibility of large prime factorization for security.
